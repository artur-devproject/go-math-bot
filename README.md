## GoMath

### Telegram Bot

GoMath is a Telegram Bot designed to develop and train the skills of solving mathematical problems for elementary school students.

Currently, when many schools work remotely, students do not have the opportunity to fully work out mathematical problems with a teacher, this Bot provides an alternative solution. It allows you to automate the process of issuing and checking tasks, and thus increase the number of tasks to be solved, which significantly improves children's mathematical skills and prevents the learning process from slowing down.

To encourage children to achieve great results, a motivation system has been implemented in the form of incentive awards and skill levels. Thus, the child can track his own achievements and strive to improve them.

All user achievements are stored in the database and can be presented upon request.

In addition, today messengers are very popular means of communication, and the release of this application in the form of a Telegram Bot is a very simple, reliable and modern solution.

**Tech stack:** JavaScript, NodeJS, Telegram API, MongoDB / Mongoose
